## 💡 CLAUDE AI DECISION MATRIX

**High-Value Target Selection:**
```python
def prioritize_dealer_targets(dealer_data):
    score = 0
    
    # Transaction volume (highest weight)  
    if dealer_data['daily_volume'] > 50000: score += 100
    elif dealer_data['daily_volume'] > 20000: score += 60
    elif dealer_data['daily_volume'] > 5000: score += 30
    
    # Payment methods (exploitation potential)
    if 'crypto' in dealer_data['payments']: score += 40
    if 'revolut' in dealer_data['payments']: score += 35  
    if 'mobilepay' in dealer_data['payments']: score += 25
    
    # Operational security (lower = easier target)
    if dealer_data['opsec_level'] < 3: score += 20
